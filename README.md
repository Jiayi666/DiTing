# The Product

“谛听” (DiTing) is a customizable news aggregator. It supports tracking RSS feeds, tracking publications through conferences or Google Scholar, performing web crawling to generate summaries, tracking Hacker News topics, etc.

It allows setting customized filters to increase the information/noise ratio. The user can also add categories or topics to the articles (manually or automatically) and then view only a specific topic. A daily brief will be generated to cover the most important things for the user based on a "description of interest" (fed into AI) provided by the user.

The user can "star/like/save" items for later reference. The user can also provide a link and ask DiTing to turn it into a "story," which the user can then save for future reference. When saving a story, the story can be saved in any user-created folders.

The "feed" will be generated periodically with abstracts to send to your email. Following the DiTing link in the email, the user can navigate to the DiTing web page to get more detailed abstracts and the link to the original content.
